"""Submissions: decoding and verifying a scan, and handing the round it carries to `server/rounds.py`.

A scan of a finished ROM's scorecard QR code carries the round's payload
(`golf/qr/payload.py`): 39 bytes in protocol version 2, which adds fairways hit and penalty
strokes, or 36 in version 1, which ROMs built before it still send and which is accepted for
good. `submit_scan` resolves it to the entry it belongs to: the seed ID
names the seed, the player ID the user, the pair their entry, and the payload's slot the
MAC key. A payload that verifies is recorded as the round for (entry, slot), and the first
one recorded stays: a later scan for the same entry and slot that also verifies, identical
or not, stores nothing and answers with the round already recorded. A voided round's
payload is refused. Both ROM slots carry the downloader's player ID, so a player 2 round
(slot 1) counts toward the same entry as slot 0. See docs/randomizer_devplan.md, "Data
model", and docs/scorecard_qr.md, "Server contract".

A rejected scan is stored nowhere. It logs its exact cause, which the page never shows.

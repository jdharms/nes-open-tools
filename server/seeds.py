"""Seed identity and the seed tables: the only code that writes `seeds`, `seed_holes` and `hole_data`.

A seed's `qr_seed_id` is drawn uniformly from 1 to 62**10 - 1, and its URL id is that
integer in base62 (`server/ids.py`), so either converts to the other. See
docs/randomizer_devplan.md, "Generating seed ids".

A slot with transforms has its hole, as built, stored in `hole_data` under its content
hash (ADR 0021): a later release's transforms may not give the same hole
(ADR 0015), and the yardage book has to show the one in the ROM.

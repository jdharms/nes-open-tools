"""A seed's yardage book: the rangefinder's metadata for its 18 holes as the seed plays them.

The book shows each hole with its transforms applied, at the seed's pin, with the wind of
its tee shot. A hole with transforms is read from `hole_data`, where the seed's build left
it (ADR 0021), and any other from the hole store. The images are rendered the first time a
book asks for them (`golf/rendering/hole_renders.py`).

The wind after the tee shot is left out on purpose: every later swing's wind follows from
the manifest too, but a book that showed it would decide the tee shot.

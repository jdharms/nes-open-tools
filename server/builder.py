"""What the site's routes call to build: a manifest from settings, its unfinished IPS, and a finished IPS.

The builder holds the catalog, curation and hole store the site generates from, and reads
the server's vanilla US ROM on first use. `warm` builds ahead of time what the first seed
would otherwise wait for, which the app does at startup. Builds run behind a semaphore, so a burst of
requests queues instead of building side by side. `prewarm` fills the transform caches
(`golf/randomizer/transform_cache.py`) for the whole catalog a hole at a time, giving way to
builds, which the app runs in a thread at startup when `Config.prewarm_transforms` is on. `create_app` takes a builder so tests
can stand one in that never reads a ROM.

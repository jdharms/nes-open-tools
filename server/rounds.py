"""Rounds: the only code that writes `rounds`, `round_holes` and `voided_rounds`.

A round is a scan that `server/submissions.py` accepted: its 36-byte payload (which carries
every hole), recorded against (entry, slot), one round per pair. Each round is drawn a
`public_id` when it is recorded, the base62 id its `/r/<id>` permalink names it by
(`server/ids.py`). No other round is ever given it, so a permalink always means one
scorecard. See docs/randomizer_devplan.md, "Data model".

An admin can flag a round, which leaves it counted and marked, or void it. A voided round
moves to `voided_rounds` with its public id, freeing its slot for a different round, and a
scan of its payload is refused until an admin restores it. Each admin action writes its
audit row through `server/audit.py` in the same transaction.

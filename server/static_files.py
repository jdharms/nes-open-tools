"""Static files with versioned URLs and the cache headers that go with them.

Templates link static files through `StaticVersions.url`, which adds `?v=` and a hash of
the file's contents, so a deploy that changes a file changes its URL. `CachedStaticFiles`
lets a browser keep a versioned response for good and makes it revalidate anything else:
the rangefinder's module imports and renders, which carry no version, and would otherwise
be cached by heuristic and outlive a deploy.

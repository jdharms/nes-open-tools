# NES Open Tournament Golf Tools

Reverse engineering, editing and patching tools for NES Open Tournament Golf: course
extraction and a course editor, ROM research tools, gameplay patches, and the groundwork
for a randomizer.

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.12
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

## Setup

### Linux / macOS

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:jdharms/nes-open-tools.git
cd nes-open-tools

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

### Windows

```powershell
# Install uv (if not already installed)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:jdharms/nes-open-tools.git
cd nes-open-tools

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

### Vanilla data

The repository holds no vanilla course data. Put your ROMs in the repository root as
`nes_open_us.nes` and, optionally, `mario_open_jp.nes`, then run:

```bash
uv run golf-rehydrate
```

It dumps every course into `courses/`, checks each hole against the catalog's content
hashes, and renders the site's rangefinder. The editor, the course tools, the site and
the tests that need real holes all read what it writes. Without the Mario Open ROM, its
courses are skipped.

Run any command below with `uv run <command>`. Every command takes `--help`, which is the
full reference for its options.

## Layout

- **golf/** - shared library: ROM reading/writing, compression, graphics, patches
  (`golf/core/patches/`), data formats, rendering, and the scorecard QR code (`golf/qr/`)
- **editor/** - the Pygame course editor
- **server/** - the randomizer website; see `server/CLAUDE.md`
- **tools/** - command-line entry points, grouped into `data/` (regenerates `data/`
  files), `research/`, `art/`, `music/` and `qr/`; course and patch tools sit at the top
  level; `archive/` holds retired one-off scripts
- **docs/** - design and reverse-engineering notes; start at `docs/README.md` and `docs/documentation.md`.
- **data/** - checked-in tables, tilesets, sprites and exports the tools and editor load
- **courses/** - course JSON: the vanilla courses `golf-rehydrate` dumps (not committed;
  the directories are kept with `.gitkeep` markers) and any of your own

| `golf-qr-credentials -o <keys.json>` | Write the seed ID, player IDs and secret MAC keys the `qr_credentials` patch reads |

## Example workflow

```bash
# Dump all courses from the ROMs (golf-dump alone writes the US ROM's, with statistics)
golf-rehydrate

# Edit a hole using the course editor
golf-editor courses/japan/hole_01.json

# Write a course (all 3 course slots play it)
golf-write nes_open_us.nes courses/japan/ -o modified.nes

# Check a course will fit without writing
golf-write nes_open_us.nes courses/japan/ --validate-only --verbose
```

## Running the site

```bash
uv run golf-site --reload
# then open http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

The site refuses to start until `golf-rehydrate` has dumped the holes of every ROM in
`GOLF_ROM_DIR` into `GOLF_HOLES_DIR` and rendered the rangefinder from them into
`GOLF_RANGEFINDER_DIR`. The course
rangefinder is at `/rangefinder`; to re-render it without dumping again:

```bash
uv run golf-render-web courses/ rangefinder/
```

The ROM setup page hashes ROMs in the browser, which needs HTTPS or localhost. Running it
on its server is `docs/deployment.md`. The site reads its configuration from environment
variables:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `GOLF_DATABASE` | `golf_site.db` | SQLite database path, created and migrated at startup |
| `GOLF_ROM_DIR` | the repository root | Directory holding the server's vanilla ROMs as `nes_open_us.nes` and `mario_open_jp.nes`; generating a seed needs the first |
| `GOLF_HOLES_DIR` | `courses/` | Hole store root, which `golf-rehydrate` writes |
| `GOLF_RANGEFINDER_DIR` | `rangefinder/` | The rangefinder's renders, which `golf-rehydrate` writes and the site serves at `/rangefinder-data/` |
| `GOLF_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8000` | Public base URL, also the OAuth redirect base |
| `GOLF_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`, `GOLF_DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` | unset | Discord sign-in |
| `GOLF_SESSION_SECRET` | unset | Signs the session cookie |
| `GOLF_ADMIN_USERS` | unset | Discord ids, separated by commas or spaces, of the users the `/admin` pages admit; `dev:<name>` ids only with `GOLF_DEV_LOGIN` |
| `GOLF_DEV_LOGIN` | off | Development-only sign-in bypass (`1`, `true`, `yes` or `on`) |
| `GOLF_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | The level the site logs at, as a `logging` level name; the log is JSON lines on stderr |

For development, keep these in a `.env` file in the repository root (gitignored) and run
`uv run --env-file .env golf-site --reload`, or set `UV_ENV_FILE=.env` in your shell so
every `uv run` loads it.

Discord sign-in needs the client id, secret and session secret, and the Discord
application's OAuth2 redirect URI registered as `<GOLF_BASE_URL>/auth/callback`. Without a
session secret, sessions are signed with a secret that lasts until the process exits. With
`GOLF_DEV_LOGIN` on, `/auth/login?as=alice` signs in as the development user `alice`
(created on first use) without Discord; the site refuses to start with it on unless
`GOLF_BASE_URL` is a localhost address.

## Running tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

"""Hole transforms: the names a manifest slot uses for rewrites of its hole.

A transform's name carries its version (`mirror@1`), and a transform that takes a seed
writes it after a colon (`hazards@1:1234`). The rewrites themselves are plain hole
operations in `golf/algorithms/`; this module names them.

Every transform's output for the vanilla holes is pinned by a golden test. Output that
changes needs a new `BUILD_VERSION`, and a new transform version if what the transform
means changed (ADR 0015, `docs/hole_transforms.md`). A version stays in `TRANSFORMS`
after a newer one ships, because the site still loads the manifests that name it.

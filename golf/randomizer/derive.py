"""
Publishing derived holes: an edited copy of a vanilla hole, turned into a delta, a
catalog entry and a curation record.

`derive` takes the hole a person edited and the vanilla hole it started from. It never
edits a hole itself: the tee box, the carved forest and the new bottom edge are all the
editor's work, and what comes out is the cells and metadata that differ (ADR 0022).
`golf-derive` (tools/data/derive.py) is the CLI on top. See docs/derived_holes.md.

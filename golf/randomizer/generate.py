"""
Generation: a catalog, a curation snapshot and settings in, a manifest out.

Every random choice comes from `settings.prng_seed`, drawn fresh when the settings have
none. Each purpose (the layout, the hole draw, the music, the magic words, the SRAM magic) gets its own
generator derived from the seed, and the wind seeds come from `derive_hole_seeds`, so a
change to how one thing is drawn leaves the others where they were.

The settings' draw rule picks the hole draw: `draw_holes` for `uniform`, and
`draw_holes_capped` for `expert_cap`.

The same catalog, curation, settings and seed give the same manifest under one
`GENERATOR_VERSION`. That is a property the tests hold generation to, not a promise across
versions: a stored manifest, not its inputs, is what a seed is. Bump the version whenever
the same inputs would give a different manifest. See docs/manifest.md.

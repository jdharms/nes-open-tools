"""
Curation: the editable judgments that steer generation, kept apart from the frozen catalog.

A record is keyed by lineage (`nes_uk/01`, never `nes_uk/01@2`), so it carries forward when
a new version is published. Generation reads a `CurationSnapshot`, a point-in-time view the
caller builds: the CLI from `data/catalog/curation.json`, the site from that file plus its
own database. Nothing here reaches a ROM. See docs/catalog.md.

A snapshot is frozen, as a catalog is: an edit returns a new snapshot, and `save` writes one
back out. `golf-curate` (tools/data/curate.py) is the editor built on these.

"""
Magic words: three words from the word bank that let a player see they have the right ROM.

The same three words head the title menus (`menu_trim`) and, joined by spaces, replace the
scorecard title (`scorecard_course_name`), and the seed page shows them. They identify a
seed at a glance, not uniquely. Every word in the bank must fit both: 4 to 6 characters
from the characters both fonts can draw.

Words are otherwise distinct, with one deliberate exception: TRIPLE_WORD may appear in
all three slots at once, as an easter egg. Each slot is drawn independently and
uniformly, so that outcome is no more likely than any other specific combination of
three words - it is just one combination among many, and rare because of that, not
because of a hand-tuned rarity constant. No other word may repeat.

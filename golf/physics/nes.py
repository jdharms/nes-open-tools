"""
Just enough of an NES to run the game's own frame loop under py65.

The physics oracle needs more than one routine: a shot involves the swing
animation (bank 8), the behind-the-golfer scene (bank 9), the cup (bank 9), the
view switches and the physics (bank 13), all far-calling each other every frame.
Rather than stub each of those, this machine gives the game what it expects:

- **MMC1 PRG banking.** The game only changes banks by writing the mapper's
  serial port (`SetPrgBank`, $D35A), so writes to $8000-$FFFF are shifted into
  a 5-bit register and the fifth write to the PRG register swaps the bank.
  Nothing else about the mapper matters here.
- **The controller** at $4016, read one button a bit, strobed by writing 1 then 0.
- **Vblank.** At each `WaitForVblank` busy loop the machine runs the game's own
  NMI handler once. That is a frame: it flushes the PPU buffer, bumps the frame
  counter, reads the controllers and runs the sound engine.
- **The PPU**, only as far as `$2002` reads: vblank set, so the few polling
  loops that read it fall through.

Everything else is plain RAM. There is no picture.

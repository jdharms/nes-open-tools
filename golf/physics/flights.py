"""
Flights shared between starts: a shot played once over uniform ground, and
reused from any start where the real ground makes no difference.

This is not a port. It is a faster way to run `golf.physics.shot`, and gives
exactly what `simulate` gives, register for register
(`tests/integration/test_flights_rom.py` checks this).

Nothing in a frame depends on where the shot started except through the ground:
every step adds the same velocities and wind wherever the ball is, and the
readout and the scene projection only look at the ball relative to the shot's
origin. The ground comes in through the probe each frame. A shot is recorded in
two parts:

1. **The air**, up to first contact, over plain fairway. The lie under a ball
   in the air changes nothing, except:

   - the overhead view's tree probe finding a trunk above a leafy edge;
   - the view switch acting over the green itself, where it goes to the green
     view (and on to the cup) instead of overhead. It acts on a falling ball,
     and on the frame the behind-the-golfer view ends;
   - the behind-the-golfer scene's trees. A `Flight` has no scene, like
     `simulate` without one.

   From the tee or the fairway nothing reads the RNG in the air, so one
   recording serves every RNG state. From the rough the launch draws on it.

2. **The roll**, from first contact to rest, over ground that is everywhere
   what the ball lands on. One is recorded for each RNG state and landing
   terrain it is asked for, since first contact reads the RNG. It holds for
   as long as the ball keeps finding exactly that terrain.

Throughout, the ball must stay on the playfield: `BallX >= $B0` stops it, and
above the top of the hole (`BallY` negative) the readout stops counting.

Where the ground makes no difference the probe still writes registers: the lie,
the rough depth, $CA, whether the ball is in the green's box, the water drop
and the sand bookkeeping. So each recording keeps the pixels the probe looked
at each frame, and a snapshot of the ball every few frames. From a real start,
`Flight.finish` walks those pixels over the real ground, working out what the
probe would have written, and stops at the first frame where the ground would
change the shot. It carries on from the snapshot before that with the real
ground, `ShotInFlight` doing the rest. A start the ground never reaches into
needs no frames played at all.

Only shots from the tee, the fairway and the rough are shared. From sand the
bunker lip rule reads the ground in the air, and a putt is played in the green
view, near the cup, from the first frame. Rolls are not shared on the green,
nor in its box, where the slope, $CA and the cup all come in.

"""
The shot's inputs, the ball's state, and the ground it lands on.

`Ball` holds the game's registers at their natural width and in the game's own
units, so a frame of the model can be compared to a frame of the ROM field for
field. Positions and velocities are fixed point with 16 fraction bits: `x` is
BallX ($AE) with $AC/$AD below it, so `x >> 16` is the pixel. One pixel is two
yards, the scale the in-flight distance readout uses.

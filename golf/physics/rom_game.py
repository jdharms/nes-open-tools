"""
A shot played through the game itself, as the reference for the model on real holes.

`RomGameShot` loads a hole with the game's own `InitHole`, puts the ball where
it is told, and runs `ShotSetupSequence`, pressing buttons the way a player
would: A through the setup panels, then A to start the swing and again to stop
each meter. From the swing on, everything is the game's frame loop running as
it does on a console: the physics, the swing animation, the behind-the-golfer
scene, the view switches and the cup (see `golf.physics.nes`).

It records the ball's registers at every frame boundary from launch to rest,
and the inputs the swing actually produced, so the model can replay the shot
from the same inputs and be compared frame by frame.

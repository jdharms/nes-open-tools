Title menu trim patch.

The title menu chain is pure data: entries can be removed, retitled and
re-pointed without touching a single instruction, because every menu is
described by four parallel tables in bank 12. See `docs/menu_system.md` for the
full layout.

What this patch does:

  * Menus $00 (main), $01 (1/2 PLAYER) and $02 (course select) share one
    two-line static-text header of three words, drawn where vanilla menu $02
    draws "PLEASE SELECT" / "COURSE".
  * Menu $00 keeps only STROKE PLAY and CLUB HOUSE.
  * Menu $02 offers a single option, RANDOM COURSE, which selects course 0
    (vanilla JAPAN COURSE).
  * Menu $15 (club house) keeps only REGISTER NAME, CHOOSE CLUBS, OPTIONS,
    TRAINING and CLEAR SAVED DATA. With `choose_clubs=False` it drops CHOOSE
    CLUBS as well, so the bag a new save starts with is the bag it keeps: a
    seed with club rules is built this way (docs/planning/download_settings.md).

Nothing is relocated. A text list is `count` followed by `count` 2-byte entry
pointers, so shortening a list means writing a smaller count and rewriting the
pointers that stay - the bytes past the new count are never read. The same is
true of `MenuSubmenuIdData`, the parallel one-byte-per-selection list of
destinations.

Header
------

The header's lines are exactly as wide as vanilla's, at the same positions:
line 1 is 13 characters at column 4, row $0A ("PLEASE SELECT"), line 2 is 6
characters at column 4, row $0C ("COURSE"). Each word is padded to a 6-column
slot, so words 1 and 2 always start at columns 4 and 11:

  line 1: word1.ljust(6) + " " + word2.ljust(6)
  line 2: word3.ljust(6)

Matching vanilla's span matters because `SetMenuEntryPalette` sets palette 1
on every 2x2 attribute cell the entry covers. An entry starting at column 3
would share a cell with the box border at column 2 and recolour it.

The header list and its line 1 entry live in the 26 bytes freed by the removed
MATCH,PLAY and TOURNAMENT entries:

  $8BB7  02 BC 8B 5C 8C            list: 2 entries, at $8BBC and $8C5C
  $8BBC  04 0A <13 chars> FF       line 1

Line 2 reuses the vanilla "COURSE" entry at $8C5C, overwriting its 6
characters. Its only reference is list $8C57, which after this patch is read
only by menus $06, $0B, $0F and $12, all unreachable. The three menus'
`MenuTextListPtrTable` static pointers are repointed at $8BB7. Every other menu
keeps the shared "PLEASE SELECT" list at $8B8D.

Course select
-------------

Menu $02's options list $8C65 is shared only with the unreachable menus $06,
$0B, $0F and $12. Its count drops to 1 and its first entry, US COURSE at $8C6C,
is overwritten with RANDOM COURSE, which runs 4 bytes into the unused JAPAN
COURSE entry. At column 12, row $0E the entry, its cursor tiles on rows $0D and
$0F, and its right cursor sprite at column 25 all land on blank background.

`ApplyCourseSelection` ($89E1) maps `CurrentMenuSelection + 1` through an
inline `LookupInlineByteTable` table at $89EA: 1 -> 1 (US), 2 -> 0 (JAPAN),
3 -> 2 (UK). With one option the key is always 1, so its value at $89EB
becomes 0 and `CurrCourse` is 0. The handler then calls $D939 as usual, which
goes to CONTINUE/NEW GAME only when a saved stroke-play game exists for that
slot.

Other wrinkles
--------------

1. Each entry carries its own Y coordinate, so removing an entry from the
   middle of a list leaves a visual gap. The retained entries below a removed
   one move up: CLUB HOUSE from row $14 to $10; club house TRAINING from $12
   to $0C and CLEAR SAVED DATA from $16 to $0E. Without CHOOSE CLUBS,
   OPTIONS moves from $0A to $08, TRAINING to $0A and CLEAR SAVED DATA to $0C.

2. `ApplyPlayModeSelection` ($89A2), menu $00's choice handler, keys off the
   *selection index*: `sel < 2` sets `GolfGameMode = sel * 4`. CLUB HOUSE is
   index 1 here and would set `GolfGameMode = $04` (match play) on the way in,
   so the guard is `CMP #$01` and only STROKE PLAY writes the mode. The handler
   is shared with menu $09, which is unreachable without TOURNAMENT.

Byte edits, all in bank 12:

  $8DF1  28 16                     -> 28 0E          CLEAR SAVED DATA row

and without CHOOSE CLUBS, in place of the last four:

  $8D64  09 77 8D 87 8D ... F1 8D  -> 04 77 8D 96 8D D1 8D F1 8D  4 entries
  $8B00  81 82 83 84               -> 81 83 87 89    club house destinations
  $8D96  28 0A                     -> 28 08          OPTIONS row
  $8DD1  28 12                     -> 28 0A          TRAINING row
  $8DF1  28 16                     -> 28 0C          CLEAR SAVED DATA row

Either way PLAYER STATS (code $84, bank 9 $B519) is out of the club house, and
nothing else reaches it. `PLAYER_STATS_REMOVED` is a requirement for patches
that reuse its code space.

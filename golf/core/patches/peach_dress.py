"""
Peach's dress: recolor the Princess Peach sprite in the putting view's left panel.

`DrawPeachPanel` (bank 13 `$BE0B`) draws her only while putting, from
`PeachBodyMetaspriteData` (`$BEF2`): the dress is the first chunk's 12 sprites, all in
sprite palette 0, and it uses only color 1 of that palette. `LoadGreenDetailViewTileset`
copies `GreenDetailPaletteData` (`$95FE`, 32 bytes) into `PaletteBuffer` whenever the
green detail view is drawn, so the dress is the single byte at `$960F`, vanilla `$25`.
Nothing else on the putting screen uses that palette entry: the flag and ball are
palette 3.

Only the curated colors below are accepted. They are the 54 non-black NES colors less
her skin (`$36`) and hair (`$28`), and less one of each pair that looks the same as
another on her sprite, judged by CIEDE2000 distance under Mesen's default palette and by
eye. `DRESS_COLOR_FAMILIES` groups them by the color they read as. Green has the most
entries because three of the NES's twelve hue columns read as green, so a caller that
wants each family equally likely picks a family first, then a color within it.

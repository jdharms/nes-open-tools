Scorecard QR patch: draw a submission QR code when a round ends.

Phase 6 of `docs/scorecard_qr.md`. Three writes:

1. **The feature itself** — the table blob and the assembled routine from
   `golf.qr.port` — into bank 2's reclaimed region, from `$8400`. That region
   is the vacated UK course: a randomized ROM carries one course, and with
   course mirroring and menu trimming there is no way to play a round on
   course 3, so nothing reads it. The seed ID, player ID and MAC key
   placeholders (`QrSeedId`, `QrPlayerId`, `QrMacKey`) are left holding
   `port.PATCH_FILL`.

2. **A trampoline** in the fixed bank at `$DCBD`, ten bytes:

       JSR $85BA              ; the scorecard's own wait-for-A/B
       JSR ExecuteFarCall     ; .db $02, <QrShowCodes, >QrShowCodes
       RTS

   `$DCBD` is slot 18 of `GreenCompressedDataPtrTable` (`$DC99`). Its only
   reader is hole setup (`$DAF1`/`$DAF6`, indexed by the doubled hole index),
   and under `COURSE_MIRRORS_PATCH` every course slot plays holes 0-17, so
   slots 18-53 (`$DCBD`-`$DD04`) are never read. The patch requires the
   mirrors for that reason. The fixed bank is always mapped, so the bank 13
   `JSR` reaches it.

3. **A two-byte splice**: the `JSR $85BA` at bank 13 `$852D` — the wait that
   follows the post-round scorecard — is repointed at that trampoline. `$85BA`
   is also called from `$8599` on the tournament path; only this call site
   moves.

The image carries no credentials because a randomized ROM is built in two
stages (`docs/randomizer_devplan.md`): this patch belongs to the unfinished
ROM built once per seed, and one of two companions finishes it per download.

- `qr_credentials` (`golf/core/patches/qr_credentials.py`) writes a player's
  seed ID, player IDs and MAC keys over the fill.
- `QR_DISABLE_PATCH` (`qr_disable`) puts the splice back to `JSR $85BA` for a
  guest ROM, so the QR screen never appears. Its expected original is the
  splice this patch wrote, so it can only follow it. Afterwards this patch
  reports neither applied (the splice is vanilla) nor applicable (the
  trampoline is not), so it cannot be re-applied to a guest ROM.

Both rewrite bytes this patch wrote, so neither can share a `PatchStack` with
it; they run in the finishing stack on top of the unfinished ROM.

Unlike `BytePatch`, this does not verify the bytes it overwrites in bank 2. The
region write is nearly four kilobytes of vanilla course data, and carrying a
copy of that to compare against would be absurd. What it *does* verify is the
splice site itself and the six-byte far call to `DrawScorecardScreen` just
above it, which is a precise enough anchor to catch a wrong or already-modified
ROM, plus that the trampoline's ten bytes still hold the vanilla greens
pointers.

(A future "reclaim" patch that fills the freed region with `$FF` would let this
one assert on the region too. See the note in the doc.)

The finishing contract
----------------------

The finishing patches run long after this one, on unfinished ROMs stored by
earlier build versions, so everything they rely on is pinned here rather than
derived from today's port: the placeholders' addresses and lengths
(`PLACEHOLDER_ADDRESSES`), the splice, and the trampoline's shape. The entry
point the trampoline far-calls is *not* part of it: `is_applied` skips those
two bytes, so the routine is free to move between build versions. Building
this patch fails if the port no longer puts a placeholder at its pinned
address. See ADR 0009.

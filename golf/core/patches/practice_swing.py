"""
Practice swing patch.

Adds a practice-swing mode to the shot loop, modeled on the Famicom Disk
System game *Golf - Japan Course*. From the "ready to swing" state, Select
toggles practice mode: the golfer steps 8 pixels back from the ball and a
full three-press swing can be taken without hitting the ball, counting a
stroke, or advancing wind state. The power and accuracy markers hold on
screen for about two seconds, then the ready state is restored so another
practice swing can be taken. Select toggles back out.

See docs/practice_swing.md for the analysis this is built on, and
docs/golfer_sprites.md for the renderer tables.

The toggle routine lives in fixed-bank free space at $CAE4, the tail of the
$CA40-$CAFF block (all $FF in vanilla) that wram_expansion also carves its
relocated tables out of. The two share the block without overlapping, and
practice swing applies with or without wram_expansion.

Layout
------

  bank 8  $BFE5-$BFF0  (12)  ApplyGolferPracticeOffset
  bank 13 $BFBF-$BFCF  (17)  CommitShotOrPractice
  bank 13 $BFD0-$BFEE  (31)  HoldPracticeSwing
  fixed   $CAE4-$CAFF  (28)  TogglePracticeSwing

Every splice is length-preserving, so nothing else in the ROM moves.

State
-----

`PracticeSwingOffset` ($05BB) is both the mode flag and the pixel shift: 0
in normal play, 8 in practice mode. It has no other reader or writer in the
ROM, and the two indexed tables that come nearest it in bank 13 ($059C,X
and $05A5,X) are both bounded at X = 0..6.

The hold timer reuses `$0586` (the swing phase). Practice hold is entered
with $0586 at 3 or 4, and the dispatch at $AAD6 routes every value >= 3 to
the state-3 handler, so the counter can climb freely to the threshold.
ShotInitialization resets it to 0.

How the four pieces fit together
--------------------------------

1. `ApplyGolferPracticeOffset` replaces the golfer's X-coordinate load in
   the bank 8 renderer, subtracting the offset. The club renderer at $8083
   saves and restores $26/$27, so the club follows the body for free. With
   the offset at 0 the arithmetic is a no-op (SEC/SBC #0).

2. `TogglePracticeSwing` takes over the ready state's B-button test, so one
   routine owns both buttons that matter: Select flips the flag, and B
   clears it before returning `SEC` to back out to club select, so practice
   mode never survives leaving the shot. Only human players reach $AB0B -
   $AAF3 sends CPU and demo players to the timeout path at $AAF5 - so it
   needs no $D5 guard.

3. `CommitShotOrPractice` replaces the `JSR IncrementStrokeCount` /
   `JSR $8D96` pair that all three commit sites share. In practice mode it
   skips both - $8D96 gates $DA17/$D94C, which advances wind RNG state, so
   a practice swing must not reach it or seeded wind desyncs - and presets
   ShotPhaseState to $FE so that the `INC $D2` following two of the three
   sites lands on $FF ("no shot in progress") instead of $00 (launch).

4. `HoldPracticeSwing` takes over the head of the state-3 handler's
   post-animation check. It forces ShotPhaseState to $FF every frame (which
   also covers the third commit site, the whiff at $AC44, that stores $02
   outright), counts frames, and calls ShotInitialization to return to the
   ready state. ShotInitialization is a complete reset here because a
   practice swing happens before the ball has moved: it restores $0586,
   $0587, $0589, $059A, $D0, $D1, $CF, $D2 and $D6/$D7 to exactly their
   values at $AA09, and its one subroutine call ($B75C) merely zeroes the
   velocity accumulators.

Practice mode ends on any exit from the shot: taking a real shot requires
toggling it off, and backing out with B clears it. The flag can therefore
never be set while another player is at the tee.

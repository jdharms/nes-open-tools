"""
SPIKE: putting practice mode.

Places the ball at a random point on the green's putting surface at hole
init instead of on the tee. Nothing else is changed - the shot loop at
bank 13 $87B5 recomputes BallLie from the ball's coordinates every shot
and branches to the putting view when it comes back 6, so the putter,
the green view and the green-space HUD all follow for free.

Not wired to a CLI. Not documented. Rough edges are listed at the bottom.

Layout
------

  bank 13 $8173-$8184  (18)  splice: JSR ExecuteFarCall + inline args
  bank 10 $BF6B-$BFD5  (107) PlaceBallOnGreen

Bank 10's tail ($BF6B-$BFF2, 136 bytes of $FF) is claimed by no other
patch. The routine is reached by ExecuteFarCall ($D372), which hands the
caller's A/X/Y to the target and restores A/X on return, so the player
index in X survives the call. The routine only touches zero page, WRAM
and the fixed bank, so it has no dependency on bank 10 being mapped
beyond its own code.

#   - The ball can land on the pin's own tile and hole out on contact.
#   - No fallback if 32 attempts all miss: it uses the last accepted
#     tile, or the center tile if none was ever accepted.
#   - MaybePlayerHoleStatus ($0111,X) is left at 0, so the distance
#     readout uses course units until after the first putt.

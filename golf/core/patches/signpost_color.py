Signpost color: recolor the brick behind the pre-hole signpost's banner.

`LC_AC2F_DrawSignpostCard` (bank 12) loads its palette with `Load32BytesToBuffer`
from `$ADC4` (`docs/prehole_signpost.md`). The banner sits in background
subpalette 1 - `$30` letters, `$21` sky, `$15` brick on `$0F` - so the brick is the
single byte at `$ADCB`. The HOLE, PAR and yards signs below it are subpalette 0 and
keep their wood colors. On long-drive and nearest-pin contest holes the game writes
`$12` over the same entry at `$AC46`, after this palette load, so those holes show a
blue banner whatever this patch sets.

The byte sits just before the banner bodies `signpost_random_banner` reclaims
(`$ADE4`-`$B01B`), so the two patches stack.

Only the curated colors below are accepted: the non-black NES colors less the
banner's own white and sky, less every color the white letters are hard to read
against (the whole pale row and the faintest of the `$2x` row), and less one of each
pair that looks the same as another. `SIGNPOST_COLOR_FAMILIES` groups them by the
color they read as, so a caller that wants each family equally likely picks a family
first, then a color within it.

`SIGNPOST_DANGEROUS_COLORS` holds colors set aside on feedback, kept for a later look.
The patch rejects them too.

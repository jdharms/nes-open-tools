"""
SRAM defaults: change what a new save starts with - the player name, both
players' club bags and the BGM option - and the magic that marks a save as
initialised.

`InitializeSram` (bank 9 $ACBC) runs at boot and returns if $6001/$6002 hold
the magic, "5S" ($35 $53). Otherwise, and when "clear saved data" option 3
enters it at $ACCB past the check, it zeroes $6003-$7185, copies in the
default name, roster names and club bags, fills $6F98-$6FAF with $FF, and
writes the magic last. Each parameter is a byte edit in that routine or its
tables:

- player_name: `DefaultPlayerNameText` at $AD5B, 10 bytes. The name-entry
  screen stores only A-Z, '.' and space, and draws nothing else.
- clubs: `DefaultClubBagTable` at $AE23, copied to both players' bags. It is
  written the way the choose-clubs screen saves a bag: at most 14 club ids,
  the putter always among them, in ascending order, padded with $FF.
- bgm: off turns the $FF fill loop's `BPL` at $AD4E into `BNE`, so the loop
  stops before X=0 and BGMOnFlag ($6F98) keeps $00 from the zero fill. The
  other bytes the loop fills are unchanged. `new_save_options` replaces the
  loop, and with it the BGM option and the swing, putt and spin defaults the
  loop cannot write; after it, only `bgm=True` applies.
- sram_magic: the operands of the check's two `CMP #` and the final two
  `LDA #`. A save holding any other magic is wiped and rebuilt at boot, so a
  save from another ROM cannot carry its bag in. Neither byte may be $00 or
  $FF, what blank SRAM usually holds: blank SRAM would pass the check and
  never be initialised.

Only a save being initialised gets these defaults.

The bags live in SRAM (`Player1ClubBag` $6027, `Player2ClubBag` $6035), which
every bank sees. `InitializeSram` is the only absolute store to them ($AD3D,
$AD40); the shot's club panel and `AutoSelectClub` read them (bank 13 $8AF8,
$8B71, $8B99), and the CHOOSE CLUBS screen loads and saves them (bank 14 $AEE9,
$AF4B). So `menu_trim` with `choose_clubs=False` freezes the bag this patch
writes: nothing left in the game changes it, and CLEAR SAVED DATA copies it back
from $AE23.

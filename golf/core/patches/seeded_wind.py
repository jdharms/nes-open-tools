Seeded wind patch: make every hole's pin position and wind sequence a pure
function of a build-time seed, identical for every player of the ROM.

Vanilla behavior (see docs/seeded_wind.md for the full trace)
--------------------------------------------------------------
The game has one 16-bit LFSR, `LSFR_RNG_ALGO` (fixed $D29C), on `RngState`
($42/$43). Per hole, `InitHole` (fixed $DA90) draws from it three times:
pin position ($DB15), wind direction anchor ($DBA0) and wind speed anchor
($DBA8). It also saves the pre-draw state to $04F9/$04FA at $DB0B.

Per shot, bank 13 keeps a per-player copy of the RNG state in $0525,X /
$0527,X ("wind slot"). Shot setup ($823A) loads the slot into RngState and
calls `WindAdjustmentRoutine` ($DA25), which draws once for the speed
jitter. Shot end ($82BE) writes RngState back into the slot. Both slots are
filled with the same state right after `InitHole` ($8185), so shot 1 is
already fair. The unfairness comes from in-shot RNG draws (putt aim noise,
rough/bunker variance, water-skip check) advancing RngState before the
write-back, so a player's *next* jitter depends on what happened during
their previous shot. The hole anchor is similarly whatever the global RNG
happened to be at hole start.

Patch
-----
1. `InitHole` seeding (fixed bank, byte-neutral). The 10-byte snapshot save
   at $DB0B is dead under this patch: every consumer of $04F9/$04FA copies
   it into RngState immediately before calling `InitHole`, and `InitHole`
   now overwrites RngState from the seed table. So those 10 bytes become:

       LDA SeedTable,X   ; X = doubled global hole index (set at $DAEE)
       STA $42
       LDA SeedTable+1,X
       STA $43

   Pin position, both anchors and both player slots then derive from the
   seed. The vanilla distributions are preserved exactly.

2. Wind slot write-back moved (bank 13). The 10 bytes after `LDX $99` at
   $82BE become NOPs, and the `JSR WindAdjustmentRoutine` at $824F is
   redirected to a 16-byte trampoline in bank 13 tail padding ($BFAF):

       LDX CurrentPlayerIndex
       JSR WindAdjustmentRoutine
       LDA $42 ; STA $0525,X
       LDA $43 ; STA $0527,X
       RTS

   The slot now advances exactly one LFSR step per swing, no matter what
   the shot draws afterwards. The resume path at $8D28 re-derives the wind
   from the shot-start snapshot and never touches the slots, so it stays
   correct.

3. Seed table: 2 bytes per hole ([$42, $43] order) for the course's 18
   holes, at the start of the course-3 block of `GreenFlagXTable`
   ($DFE7-$E00A). That block is dead once `COURSE_MIRRORS_PATCH` is applied,
   and `CoursePatch` only writes metadata for holes 0-17, so the seed table
   survives a `golf-write` in either order.

Requires COURSE_MIRRORS_PATCH (otherwise the UK flag X offsets get
clobbered). Practice-mode manual wind ($04F6 bit 7) and replay playback are
untouched.

`predict_hole()` models the seeded chain in Python so a Mesen session can
be checked against the expected pin index, anchors and per-swing wind.

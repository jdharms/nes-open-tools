"""
QR credentials patch: finish a scorecard QR image with one player's seed ID,
player IDs and MAC keys.

`scorecard_qr` installs the QR screen with its placeholders (`QrSeedId`,
`QrPlayerId`, `QrMacKey`) left holding `port.PATCH_FILL`. A randomized ROM is
built in two stages (`docs/randomizer_devplan.md`): the unfinished ROM, QR
image included, is built once per seed, and this patch writes the credentials
per download, in the finishing stack.

Three byte patches, one per placeholder. Each expects the fill as its original
bytes, so:

- finishing can only land on an unfinished image, one `scorecard_qr` wrote;
- a ROM already finished with other credentials is refused rather than
  overwritten;
- finishing twice with the same credentials writes nothing.

A credential byte equal to the fill writes nothing either. An all-zero seed ID
or player ID is what an unfinished ROM submits, and the server rejects it.

The IDs are public. **The keys are not**: they are what stops a player
submitting a scorecard as somebody else, they live server-side keyed to
(seed, player, slot), and they never appear in a manifest or a report.

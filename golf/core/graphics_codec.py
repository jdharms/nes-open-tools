"""
Decoder for the game's compressed graphics streams (`$D4C3` in the fixed bank).

Every pixel the game displays arrives through this codec: the cartridge has no
CHR ROM (mapper 1, `CHR 8KB banks: 0`), so pattern data, nametables and
attribute tables are all decompressed into video memory at runtime.  Roughly a
third of the 256KB PRG is data in this format.

A *graphics table* is the unit the game points at.  `LD494_DecompressGraphicsTable`
(`$D494`) reads its header and feeds each stream to the decompressor::

    dest_lo, dest_hi     ; starting PPU address
    count                ; number of streams
    ptr_lo, ptr_hi       ; x count

Two details are easy to get wrong and produce plausible-looking corruption
rather than an obvious failure:

1. **Streams chain.**  `$54`/`$55` carries over between streams of one table, so
   stream N starts where stream N-1 stopped, and `$52`/`$53` - the base that
   lookback offsets are relative to - is re-latched from it for each stream.

2. **The backwards-lookback mode reads `$2007` twice** before its copy loop
   (`$D670` and `$D673`) where the forward modes read it once.  It therefore
   copies ``mem[src-n+1 .. src]`` reversed, not ``mem[src-n .. src-1]``.

Opcode layout, decoded from `$D4CB`-`$D505`:

===========  ==================================================================
Short form   ``mode | (length-1)``, one byte, length 1-32, any mode but ``$E0``
Long form    ``$E0 | (mode >> 3) | (length >> 8)`` then ``length & $FF``,
             two bytes, length 1-1024
===========  ==================================================================

Modes:

=======  ======================================================================
``$00``  literal - ``length`` bytes follow
``$20``  run - one byte, repeated
``$40``  two-byte pattern - two bytes, ``length`` pairs (advances ``2*length``)
``$60``  incrementing run - one byte, then +1 each step
``$80``  copy ``length`` bytes already in video memory at ``base + offset``
``$A0``  same, bit-reversing each byte (a horizontal tile flip)
``$C0``  same, reading backwards (a vertical tile flip)
=======  ======================================================================

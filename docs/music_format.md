# Music Engine and Track Format

> **Note**: This document was written by Claude based on investigation requested by jdharms.

The entire audio engine — sequencer, sound effects, and all music data — lives in
**bank 14** (PRG `0x38000`-`0x3BFFF`, CPU `$8000`-`$BFFF`). The only audio data outside
that bank is the DPCM sample set, which sits in the fixed bank at `$C000`-`$CA3F`
(`DmcDrum2Data`, `DmcDrumData`, `DmcUnknownData`).

Music is fully data-driven: a track is an order list of patterns, and a pattern is an
11-byte header plus one contiguous block holding five channel streams. Adding a track
means adding an order list, headers, and stream bytes — no code changes.

Read anything below with, e.g.:

```bash
golf-rom-peek nes_open_us.nes read '$8F2E' --bank 14 --length 88
golf-rom-peek nes_open_us.nes --labels "NES Open Tournament Golf (USA).mlb" disasm '$8899' --bank 14 --count 60
```

## Per-frame entry

The NMI handler switches to bank `$0E` and calls `$8000`:

```
$D2F2  LDA #$0E
$D2F4  JSR SetPrgBank
$D2F7  JSR $8000          ; AudioEngineMain
```

`AudioEngineMain` (`$8000`) does, in order:

1. `$4017 = $C0` (4-step frame counter, IRQ inhibited).
2. Builds the `$4015` enable mask from `SfxActiveFlag` (`$FE`) and `SfxChannelMask` (`$07FE`).
3. `JSR $83C1`, `JSR $8578`, `JSR $8784` — three sound-effect handlers.
4. Reads `$FF`. **While `$FF` is non-zero the music sequencer does not run at all**; on a
   change it resets the sequencer state and re-enables `$4015`. When `$FF` is zero it calls
   `$8899`, the music sequencer.
5. Zeroes `$F0`-`$F4`, the one-shot request registers.

## Control registers

| Addr | Role |
|---|---|
| `$F0`-`$F3` | sound-effect request bytes, consumed and cleared each frame |
| **`$F4`** | **music request** — `$01`-`$17` start that track; any value with bit 7 set (the game always uses `$80`) stops all music. Cleared each frame. |
| `$F5`,`$F6`,`$F7` | ID of the SFX currently occupying each SFX channel (persistent) |
| `$F9` | **currently playing music ID** |
| `$FA`/`$FB` | pointer to the active pattern's stream block |
| `$FC`/`$FD` | scratch (header pointer, then period math) |
| `$FF` | music suspend — non-zero disables the sequencer entirely |
| `$07DC` | music ID latched for the order-list lookup |
| `$07DD` | position within the order list |
| `$07D7` | loop position within the order list |
| `$07CE` | master volume, `$0F` at full; the fade path decrements it |

Note the two pre-existing `.mlb` labels here read the wrong way round: `$FF`
(`MusicRequest`) is the *suspend* gate and `$07FC` (`CurrentMusicID`) only mirrors it. The
actual request register is `$F4` and the playing track is `$F9`.

Starting a track: `LDA #id : STA $F4`. Stopping: `LDA #$80 : STA $F4`. The engine ignores a
request equal to the track already playing only where the caller checks — `$8899` itself
restarts unconditionally, so callers such as the title screen (`bank 12 $8066`) compare
`$F9` first.

## Order lists

**`MusicOrderBaseTable`** — `$8E9E`-`$8EB5`, 24 bytes, indexed by music ID `$00`-`$17`.
Entry `$FF` (ID `$00`) means "no track". The value is an offset into the order data.

**`MusicOrderData`** — `$8EB6`-`$8F29`. A track's list starts at `$8E9F + base`:

- **byte 0** is the *loop position* — the order-list index to jump back to when the list ends.
- **bytes 1..** are order entries, terminated by `$00`.

Entry values:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `$00` | end of list — reload position from `$07D7` and keep playing |
| `$01` | set `$07C1 = 1`, then continue to the next entry |
| `$02` | set `$07C1 = 0`, then continue to the next entry |
| `>= $03` | offset of an 11-byte pattern header |

`$07C1` doubles a note byte before the octave/period lookup (`$808B`). Every track's first
order entry is `$02`, so it is always 0 for music; it exists for the SFX paths.

A header offset is added to one of three bases, chosen by music ID:

| Music ID | Header base |
|---|---|
| `< $04` | `$8F2A` |
| `< $10` | `$900A` |
| `>= $10` | `$90C5` |

All three point into **one** table — `$900A` is `$8F2A + $E0` and `$90C5` is `$900A + $BB`.
The split exists only because the offset byte is 8-bit. `$8F2A`-`$8F2D` is four bytes of
`$00` padding, which is why offsets from the first base are always `4 + 11k`: it keeps a
real header from ever having offset `$00`, `$01`, or `$02` and colliding with the commands
above.

## Pattern headers

**`MusicPatternHeaderTable`** — `$8F2E`-`$913D`: **48 headers, 11 bytes each**. 47 are
referenced by some track; header #34 (`$90A4`) is an orphan.

| Off | Loaded into | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `$07E0` | tempo — base index into the duration table |
| 1-2 | `$FA`/`$FB` | little-endian pointer to this pattern's stream block |
| 3 | `$07F0` | start offset of the **triangle** stream |
| 4 | `$07F1` | start offset of the **pulse 1** stream |
| 5 | `$07EF`, `$07DB` | start offset of the **noise** stream, and its loop point |
| 6 | `$07EE`, `$07D9` | start offset of the **DMC** stream, and its loop point |
| 7 | `$07D5`, `$07D3` | pulse 2 duty/volume envelope base into `$81A4` |
| 8 | `$07D4`, `$07D2` | pulse 1 duty/volume envelope base |
| 9 | `$07B9` | pulse 2 vibrato parameter |
| 10 | `$07B8` | pulse 1 vibrato parameter |

Pulse 2 always starts at offset 0, so it needs no header field.

**A start offset of `$00` disables that channel for the pattern** — each channel handler
begins `LDA <offset> : BEQ skip` (`$8B52`, `$8C94`, `$8CEC`, `$8D74`). Header `$90AF` uses
this to run without the DMC channel.

Because the offsets are single bytes, **one pattern's stream block cannot exceed 255 bytes**
— and the ROM already runs close to that ceiling: the largest block (header `$90E6`, stream
`$A18E`) is 247 bytes. A denser or longer pattern has to be split across two order entries.

## Stream encoding

The five channel streams sit contiguously in the block, in the order
pulse 2, pulse 1, triangle, noise, DMC.

**The stream order does not match the APU register order.** The first stream — the one at
offset 0, which usually carries the melody — drives **pulse 2** (`$4004`-`$4007`), and the
second drives **pulse 1** (`$4000`-`$4003`). The period writer at `$8084` is entered with
`X` = 4, 0 and 8 respectively (`$8077`, `$8082`, `$807B`), and `STA $4002,X` does the rest.
This is easy to get backwards from a static read; it shows up immediately in an APU write log.

Common to every channel: **a byte with bit 7 set sets the current duration.**
`duration = DurationTable[tempo + (byte & $1F)]` frames, and it applies to every following
note until changed.

Otherwise:

| Channel | Reader | `$00` | `$01` | `$02`-`$7E` | `$7F` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pulse 2 | `$8A06` | **end of pattern** — advance the order list | next byte → `$4005` sweep | note | rest |
| Pulse 1 | `$8B64` | next byte → `$4001` sweep | note | note | rest |
| Triangle | `$8CA6` | (not handled) | note | note | rest |
| Noise | `$8CFE` | loop back to this pattern's noise start | drum | drum | drum |
| DMC | `$8D86` | loop back to this pattern's DMC start | no-op | clear `SfxChannelMask` | sample |

**Pulse 2's `$00` is what ends a pattern.** The other melodic channels have no terminator —
they are simply sized to match, and stop being read when pulse 2 finishes. Noise and DMC
loop within the pattern, so a two-bar drum figure is stored once.

Across the 47 referenced patterns, pulse 2's `$00` lands exactly on the pulse 1 start
offset in all 47, and the summed frame counts of pulse 2, pulse 1 and triangle agree
exactly in 43. The four that differ (`$8FA7`, `$900A`, `$90BA`, `$90C5`) have one channel
over- or under-running by a single note, which the pattern boundary truncates.

### Noise values

A drum byte `v`:

- `v < $40` — three parallel byte tables indexed by `v` supply `$400C`, `$400E` and `$400F`
  from `$8232+v`, `$8233+v`, `$8234+v`. Records overlap, so `v` is a byte offset, not a
  record index.
- `v >= $40` — `v << 2` is stashed in `$07DA`, `$400F = 8`, and a 16-step decay envelope is
  driven from `$8866` or `$8876`, writing `$400C` and `$400E` each frame.

### DMC values

High nibble = DPCM sample id, written to `$F3` and played by `DmcUpdate` (`$8DF3`) via
`DmcSampleDurationTable` (`$8DCB`), `DmcSampleRateTable` (`$8DD5`) and `DmcSamplePtrTable`
(`$8DDF`, 10 address/length pairs). Low nibble goes to `$07D8`.

## Pitch

A note byte is **not** an absolute pitch. Every melodic channel routes its note through
`ApplyNoteTranspose` (`$8887`) first, which adds a per-track semitone offset:

```
$8887  LDY PlayingMusicID
       LDA MusicTransposeTable,X   ; $884F, signed
       LDX MusicNoteDoublingFlag   ; $07C1
       BEQ +
       SEC : SBC #$0E              ; doubling mode transposes a further -14
+      CLC : ADC <note byte>
```

So, for a note byte `b` in `$02`-`$7E`:

```
n      = (MusicTransposeTable[music_id] + b) & $FF
r      = ((n - 1) mod 12) + 1        ; 1 = C ... 12 = B
shift  = 1 + (n - 1) / 12
period = PeriodTable[r] >> shift
```

`PeriodTable` is 12 little-endian words at **`$818C`-`$81A3`** (the word at `$818A` itself is
not a note); `r = 1` is `$0D5C` = 3420. The note name is
`['C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','A#','B'][(n-1) mod 12]` at octave
`2 + (n-1)/12`.

`$7F` is a rest and silences the channel.

**`MusicTransposeTable`** (`$884F`, indexed by music ID) is what makes several tracks that
share order data distinct songs rather than duplicates:

| ID | `$01` | `$02` | `$03` | `$04` | `$05` | `$06` | `$07` | `$08` | `$09` | `$0A` | `$0B` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| semitones | -4 | -3 | 0 | -8 | +4 | -8 | -2 | 0 | -4 | -6 | +6 |

| ID | `$0C`-`$0F` | `$10` | `$11` | `$12` | `$13` | `$14` | `$15` | `$16` | `$17` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| semitones | 0 | -8 | +4 | 0 | -4 | -8 | -2 | 0 | 0 |

Tracks `$05`, `$08` and `$10` share one order list but play at +4, 0 and -8; tracks
`$09`-`$0F` share another at -4, -6, +6 and 0.

Verified against the hardware registers the engine actually writes: for track `$01`, note
bytes `$2E`/`$25`/`$1E` on pulse 2 / pulse 1 / triangle produce timer periods
160 / 269 / 403, matching an emulated run of the engine exactly.

## Duration table

**`$8107`-`$8189`** — seven tempo rows of 19 bytes, at offsets 0, 19, 38, 57, 76, 95 and 114.
Each row is built on a beat unit of 18, 16, 14, 12, 10, 8 and 6 frames respectively — so a
lower tempo base is a slower song.

Within a row, `d = byte & $1F`:

- `d = 0..9` — straight durations: ¼, ⅓, ½, 1½, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 beats.
- `d = 10..18` — triplet and subdivided durations.

Only three rows are used by music headers: **38**, **57** (nearly every pattern) and **76**.
The rest belong to the SFX paths.

## Volume and duty

**`$81A4`** is a table of `$4000`/`$4004` register values (`DDLC VVVV`) in rows of 16. The
index is `header envelope base + current volume`, where the volume counter (`$07E3` for
pulse 2, `$07E2` for pulse 1, seeded from `$07CE`) counts down — so the envelope reads
backwards and decays, holding on the row's first entry. Envelope bases seen in headers are
`$00`, `$10`, `$20`, `$30`, `$40`, `$50`, `$60`.

## Tracks

| ID | Order list (after the loop byte) | Requested from |
|---|---|---|
| `$01` | `02 04 0F 0F 1A 0F 0F 1A 25 30 30 25 3B 46` | title screen, bank 12 `$8071` (guarded by `CMP $F9`), `$846A` |
| `$02` | `02 51 5C 67 51 5C 72 7D 88 7D 93` | US course BGM — `CourseBgmTable` |
| `$03` | `02 9E A9 B4 9E A9 BF CA D5 CA E0` | Japan course BGM — `CourseBgmTable` |
| `$04` | `02 0B 16 0B 21 2C 37 2C 42 4D 58` | UK course BGM — `CourseBgmTable`; also bank 12 `$A372` |
| `$05` | `02 63 6E` | bank 12 `$9493` |
| `$06` | `02 79 84 79 8F` | bank 9 `$BDC3`, bank 11 `$876B`, `$8E92` |
| `$07` | `02 A5` | bank 12 `$9994` |
| `$08` | `02 63 6E` | bank 12 `$8F58` (prize money screen) |
| `$09`-`$0F` | `02 B0 BB` | bank 12 `$A4C8`, `$A7CC` (as `$09`; `$0B`-`$0F` share the order data and have no caller) |
| `$0A` | *(shares `$09`'s base)* | bank 13 `$8529`, `$8595` — hole start |
| `$10` | `02 63 6E` | bank 12 `$AB94` |
| `$11` | `02 58` | bank 12 `$AD03`, `$B800` |
| `$12` | `02 21` | bank 12 `$AD08`, `$B817` |
| `$13` | `02 16` | bank 12 `$B7E9` |
| `$14` | `02 42` | bank 12 `$B1C8` |
| `$15` | `02 4D` | no immediate-mode caller found |
| `$16` | `02 0B` | no immediate-mode caller found |
| `$17` | `02 2C 2C 37` | no immediate-mode caller found |

Tracks `$11`-`$17` are single-pattern jingles. Their order entries look like track `$04`'s
(`0B`, `16`, `21`, ...) but resolve against a different header base (`$90C5` rather than
`$900A`), so they are *different* patterns despite the shared offsets — no pattern in the
ROM is used by more than one track.

### Course BGM

`$D9FE` in the fixed bank is the only place `BGMOnFlag` gates music. The flag has four
references in all: the OPTIONS screen writes it at bank 11 `$8BCE` and reads it back at
`$8BF2`, bank 9 `$AD4A` initializes it, and this routine consumes it:

```
$D9FE  LDA #$00
$DA00  STA $FF                  ; lift the music suspend
$DA02  LDX CurrCourse           ; $0102
$DA05  LDA BGMOnFlag            ; $6F98 (SRAM)
$DA08  BEQ done                 ; music off -> play nothing
$DA0A  LDA CourseBgmTable,X     ; $DA14
$DA0D  CMP $F9                  ; already playing?
$DA0F  BEQ done
$DA11  STA $F4
```

`CourseBgmTable` at **`$DA14`** is three bytes: `03 02 04` — Japan → `$03`, US → `$02`,
UK → `$04`.

## Composing for this engine

`docs/composing.md` is the composer-facing version of this document: the same constraints
stated musically (voices, tempos, note lengths, ranges, the seven instrument presets) with a
text notation to write in and no ROM detail. Hand that one to a musician; this one is for
whoever wires the result into the ROM.

The seven instrument presets in that guide are the envelope rows of `MusicVolumeEnvelopeTable`:
`round` = base `$00`, `soft` = `$10`, `blip` = `$20`, `bright` = `$30`, `swell` = `$40`,
`reed` = `$50`, `accent` = `$60`.

## Playback

`golf-export-music` (`tools/music/export.py`, logic in `golf/core/audio.py`) turns the ROM
into something you can actually listen to, two ways.

**NSF** — the faithful one. Bank 14 plus the DPCM page are packaged as a bankswitched NSF
so a real player runs the original 6502 engine, vibrato, envelopes and all:

```bash
golf-export-music nes_open_us.nes -o nes_open_golf.nsf
```

23 songs, one per music ID `$01`-`$17`. The file is 24,704 bytes: a 128-byte header and six
4 KB pages — bank 14 at `$8000`-`$BFFF`, the DPCM sample page at `$C000`, and a small stub
at `$D000`. INIT clears RAM (but never the stack page, or it could not return), sets
`MusicRequest` to song + 1 and sets `SfxActiveFlag` so the percussion plays; PLAY is
`JMP AudioEngineMain`. The engine needs nothing outside those two banks — it makes no calls
into the fixed bank, and `$C000`+ is touched only by DPCM DMA.

**Relocatable JSON** — `--dump` writes tracks as data an inserter can place anywhere:
the order list, each pattern header with its stream pointer replaced by an index, the raw
stream bytes, and the 16-byte volume/duty rows the pattern headers index (`envelope_rows`,
keyed by the base byte). Everything else the engine looks up — durations, periods,
vibrato, noise drums, DPCM samples — is byte-identical between the two ROMs, so the
envelope rows are the only table that has to travel with a track. `--tracks courses` (the
default) picks the three course themes out of `CourseBgmTable`.

```bash
golf-export-music mario_open_jp.nes --dump --reference nes_open_us.nes -o jp.music.json
```

**The DPCM kit** — `--drums` exports the ten built-in drum samples as their own NSF, one
song per slot, so they can be auditioned on real hardware rather than through the software
APU:

```bash
golf-export-music nes_open_us.nes --drums -o docs/drum_kit.nsf
```

Its stub stops the music, sets `SfxActiveFlag`, and writes the sample id to
`DmcSampleRequest` every 48 frames, letting the game's own `DmcUpdate` start and cut off each
hit.

There are ten slots but only three recordings: `DmcSamplePtrTable` points 1/2/4/5/6 at
`$C000`, 3 at `$C340`, and 7/8/9/10 at `$C540`; the duplicates differ only in playback rate.
The music uses almost none of them — across all 47 patterns it is 676 hits of slot 3, 15 of
slot 1, one of slot 2, and nothing else; the `$C540` recording never appears in music at all.
On the noise channel it is `$02` x240, `$06` x35 and `$0A` x7, plus `$16` as a rest.
Samples 4-10 take their rate from `DmcSampleRateTable`, but **1-3 take it from the low nibble
of the stream byte**, so they can be pitched per note and have no single correct speed - the
renderer defaults to the value the music uses most. Each hit is truncated when `DmcUpdate`'s
frame counter expires and it clears the `$4015` enable bit, so the stored sample is usually
longer than what you hear; the renderer reproduces that cut-off.

An APU write log (`run_engine`) is the most direct way to check a claim about the engine.
Reading one is what showed that the first stream drives pulse 2 rather than pulse 1, and
that note bytes pass through `MusicTransposeTable` — neither was obvious from the
disassembly.

## The Japanese ROM

`mario_open_jp.nes` (Mario Open Golf) runs the **same engine**, assembled at shifted
addresses — routines move by +14, +42 and +62 bytes at different points — so nothing can be
hardcoded. `discover_layout()` recovers every table by matching the instruction that reads
it, and everything in this document applies to both ROMs.

What is the same:

- the zero-page and `$07xx` RAM map, exactly — `$F4`, `$F9`, `$FA/$FB`, `$FE`, `$FF`, `$07DC`…
- `AudioEngineMain` at bank 14 `$8000`, so the NSF stub needs no changes
- `MusicOrderBaseTable` at `$8E9E`, by coincidence
- the **duration table**, byte for byte: tempos and note lengths port unchanged
- the noise drum table for every value the music uses

What differs:

| | US | JP |
|---|---|---|
| header bases | `$8F2A` / `$900A` / `$90C5` | `$8F3C` / `$8FFB` / `$90A0` / `$9119` (four) |
| duration table | `$8107` | `$8115` |
| period table | `$818A` | `$8198` |
| envelope table | `$81A4` | `$81B2` |
| transpose table | `$884F` | `$888D` |
| `StartCourseBgm` | `$D9FE` | `$D9C8` |
| `BGMOnFlag` | `$6F98` | `$6BE1` |
| `CourseBgmTable` | `$DA14` = `03 02 04` | `$D9DE` = `04 03 0B 02 0C 03` |
| courses | 3, three themes | **6 slots, five distinct themes** (slots 2 and 6 share `$03`) |
| patterns | 47 | 53 |

The course table's length is stored nowhere, so it is read until a byte stops being a
playable music ID — in both ROMs the byte after the table is `$2C` (`BIT abs`), which is not
a valid track. The JP course themes are `$02`, `$03`, `$04`, `$0B` and `$0C`, and unlike the
US ones they span four different tempo bases (0, 19, 38 and 57) rather than all sitting at
57.

**The one thing that matters for porting a track between them**: the JP period table is the
US table's window shifted up two semitones, so the same note byte sounds a whole tone
sharper. Adding **+2 to a JP track's transpose byte** makes it play identically in the US
ROM — the octave arithmetic works out exactly, including across the wrap at the top of the
table.

The other difference a port has to carry is the envelope table. The US table runs
`$81A4`-`$8231` (rows `$00`-`$60`); the JP one runs `$81B2`-`$826F` and its course themes
index rows up to `$B0`, which do not exist in the US ROM. Rows `$10`-`$60` are identical
in both; row `$00` is not (US `94 94 ...` at 50% duty against JP `55 55 ...` at 25%). A
row may also overlap what follows the table — JP's `$B0` borrows its top two bytes from
the noise drum table — and that is what the engine reads, so it is what a dump captures.

## Inserting a track

The `music_import` step of `golf-patch` (`golf/core/patches/music_import.py`) puts a
dump back into a ROM. It is a **proof of concept**: it writes over music `$02`, `$03` and
`$04` in the vanilla US ROM — exactly the three `CourseBgmTable` entries — and fits
what it imports into the space those three tracks already occupy. By default it imports
the dump's own `$02`, `$03` and `$04`, and no code outside the music data changes; with
`track` it imports one track as the only course theme (see
[One course theme](#one-course-theme)).

```bash
golf-export-music mario_open_jp.nes --dump --reference nes_open_us.nes \
    -o data/music/music_jp_courses.json
golf-patch nes_open_us.nes -p music_import:dump=data/music/music_jp_courses.json -o jp_music.nes
golf-patch nes_open_us.nes -p music_import:dump=data/music/music_jp_courses.json,track=0x0C -o one.nes
```

Removing the three US course themes frees four regions, and nothing else in the ROM
reaches into any of them — their 22 pattern headers are contiguous and shared with no
other track, and no surviving pattern's stream pointer lands inside their stream block:

| Region | Extent | Bytes | JP courses need |
|---|---|---|---|
| Order data | `$8EC6`-`$8EEC` | 39 | 36 |
| Pattern headers | `$8F7B`-`$906C` | 242 (22 slots) | 187 (17) |
| Stream data | `$9379`-`$9CA3` | 2347 | 1578 |

The relocated envelope table goes in what is left of the stream block: US rows
`$00`-`$6F` verbatim, so every track that is not being replaced is untouched, then one
appended row per imported envelope the US table does not already contain, with the
imported pattern headers repointed at the new indices. Both readers of the table —
`$8B31` for pulse 2 and `$8C7F` for pulse 1 — have their operands rewritten, which is why
`discover_layout` finds the table at its new address afterwards.

The one allocation constraint is that a header offset is a single byte added to a base
chosen by music ID, so a header for track `$04` (base `$900A`) cannot sit below `$900D`.
The allocator checks this rather than assuming it.

Verified by running the game's own engine over both ROMs under py65: for all three
imported tracks the patched US ROM emits a byte-identical APU write log to the JP ROM
across 30 seconds of playback, and every other track's log is unchanged from vanilla
(`tests/integration/test_music_import_rom.py`).

### One course theme

With `menu_trim` ([menu_system.md](menu_system.md)) a round always runs with `CurrCourse`
0, so it only plays `CourseBgmTable`'s first entry, `$03`. `track` imports one dump track,
of any ID, as music `$03` into all of the freed space above, and makes two edits so that
nothing requests `$02` or `$04` whatever `CurrCourse` holds:

| Edit | Where | Vanilla | Patched |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CourseBgmTable` | fixed bank `$DA14` | `03 02 04` | `03 03 03` |
| The other request for `$04` | bank 12 `$A373`, the operand of `LDA #$04` | `04` | `03` |

`$A372` is the only request for `$04` outside the table in the [Tracks](#tracks) table, and
`$02` has none. Both come from a static search, not a breakpoint sweep. The scene at
`$A35F` is entered from bank 9 `$B1A6` and `$B2C8`, near `CurrentWager`.

Header slots stay within reach: base `$8F2A` reaches 16 of the 22 slots, and the largest
JP course theme, `$02`, has 7 patterns. The same APU write-log comparison checks the one
track against its own ID in the JP ROM.

A production version would discover the layout instead of hardcoding US addresses, and
would need somewhere to put a track that does not fit in what it displaces — see "Space"
below.

## Space

| Region | Extent | Bytes |
|---|---|---|
| Order base table | `$8E9E`-`$8EB5` | 24 |
| Order data | `$8EB6`-`$8F29` | 116 |
| Pattern headers | `$8F2E`-`$913D` | 528 (48 × 11) |
| Stream data | `$913E`-`$A60F` | 5330 |
| Padding | `$A610`-`$A63F` | 48 (`$FF`, unconfirmed) |

Bank 14 above `$A640` is **not audio at all**: it holds four menu screens — Choose Clubs
(`$AE14`), Hall of Fame Holes (`$B420`), Clear Saved Data (`$B8C7`) and Training (`$BD04`) —
plus their data. Each is reached only by `ExecuteFarCall bank $0E <addr>` from bank 12, so
relocating them is a matter of retargeting four inline argument triples. That is the one
realistic way to free a large contiguous block in the bank the sequencer can actually reach;
see the note on addressing above.

## Confidence

Everything above is derived from static disassembly plus a decoder that round-trips the
data (see "Stream encoding" for the two consistency checks it passes). What that
establishes is the *format*; it does not establish the ID → in-game-cue mapping. The
`CourseBgmTable` entries and the title theme are pinned by their call sites; the rest of
the "Requested from" column is the call site only, and which screen or event each one
belongs to has not been confirmed in an emulator.

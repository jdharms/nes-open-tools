"""
The QR credentials patch: the credentials themselves, where the patch writes
them, and that an image finished with them still runs.

The last test overlays what the patch would write onto the unfinished image
and runs it, which is what proves the credentials landed in the placeholders
rather than somewhere plausible-looking.

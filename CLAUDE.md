# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A toolset for reverse engineering, editing and patching the NES Open Tournament Golf ROM:

- Course extraction, compression and writing, plus a Pygame course editor
- ROM research tooling (reads, disassembly, reference finding, a Mesen label file)
- Gameplay and presentation patches (seeded wind, practice swing, signpost art, music, ...)
- An end-of-round scorecard QR code with a 6502 port
- Groundwork for a randomizer website (`docs/randomizer.md`)

## Finding Things

- **Commands**: every CLI tool is indexed in `README.md`; each tool's `--help` is its
  full reference. Run them with `uv run <command>`.
- **Docs**: `docs/README.md` indexes the design and reverse-engineering notes.
- **The ROM**: `docs/rom_map.md` maps a topic to the bank, address and label to start
  from. Whenever you have to search the ROM to find where something lives, add a row
  there before you finish (`docs/jp_rom_map.md` for the Mario Open ROM).
  `docs/rom_disassembly.md` covers keeping the label file complete and correct.
- **Decisions**: `docs/adr/` records why things are the way they are, what was turned
  down, and when to revisit. Check the index in `docs/adr/README.md` for your area before
  changing a design; `golf-adr` creates records (Claude drafts them as `proposed`, with
  `--drafted-by Claude`). Code cites a record as "ADR" and its four-digit number.
- **Area-specific guidance** loads from nested files when you work there:
  `editor/CLAUDE.md` (editor architecture, adding editor tools), `golf/qr/CLAUDE.md`
  (the QR oracle and its 6502 port), `golf/physics/CLAUDE.md` (the ball physics model and
  its opt-in tests) and `server/CLAUDE.md` (the randomizer website).
- **Skills** in `.claude/skills/`:
  - `nes-open-golf-rom-layout` - memory map, pointer tables, bank layouts, data region
    boundaries. Use for ROM reading/writing and course data work.
  - `nes-open-golf-rom-peek` - **use whenever inspecting a ROM**: reading bytes,
    disassembling, tracing callers, looking for reclaimable space.
  - `nes-open-golf-label-conventions` - naming rules for the `.mlb` label file.

## Repository Layout

- `golf/` - shared library
  - `core/` - ROM reading/writing, both compression codecs, NES graphics, golfer sprites
    (the swing in `golfer_sprites.py`, the cutscene poses in `cutscene_sprites.py`),
    signpost, audio, `asm6502.py` assembler, `rom_analysis.py`, `rom_trace.py` (code
    reachability), `text_script.py` (the bank 11 dialogue script walker), `object_script.py`
    (the scene object walker), `known_data.py`
    (data regions the repo can locate), `ips.py` (IPS patch files),
    `rng.py` (the game's RNG and wind) and `clubs.py`, kept out of `patches/` so the
    physics and the difficulty solver can run under PyPy
  - `golf/core/patches/` - ROM patches (`ROMPatch`, `BytePatch`, `CompositePatch`), and
    `PatchStack` for building a ROM from an ordered list of them (`docs/patch_stack.md`)
  - `formats/` - hole data model and JSON serialization (see `docs/course_data.md`)
  - `algorithms/` - hole-editing algorithms shared by the editor and the randomizer:
    terrain features (fairways, bunkers, water), the hazard shapes cut from them, the
    out-of-bounds line, fitting border tiles to a painted shape
    (`docs/feature_brush.md`), forest fill, and the hole transforms' mirror and hazard
    redraws (`docs/hole_transforms.md`)
  - `rendering/` - PIL rendering for static images
  - `qr/` - scorecard QR reference implementation and 6502 port
  - `physics/` - Python model of the ball physics (launch to rest), checked frame by frame
    against the ROM under py65; see `docs/shot_physics.md`
  - `adr.py` - architecture decision records: parsing, checks, the index, new records
- `golf/difficulty/` - rating holes: the player model, the landing table, the green
  solved whole and the solver
  (`golf-difficulty`; `docs/hole_difficulty.md`)
- `editor/` - the course editor
- `server/` - the randomizer website (FastAPI); conventions in `server/CLAUDE.md`, design in
  `docs/randomizer_devplan.md`
- `deploy/` - the site's systemd unit, Caddyfile, Litestream configuration and release
  script, described in `docs/deployment.md`
- `tools/` - CLI entry points: `data/` (regenerates checked-in `data/` files), `research/`,
  `art/`, `music/`, `qr/`; course and patch tools at the top level; `archive/` for retired
  one-off scripts (no entry points)
- `docs/`, `data/`, `renders/` (render scripts and output)
- `courses/` - course JSON, not committed: `golf-rehydrate` dumps the vanilla courses here
  from the ROMs (see **Vanilla data** below)
- `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/` - integration tests need `nes_open_us.nes` in the repo root
- `tests/physics/` - the physics model's checks against the ROM; slow, so they only run
  with `--physics` (see `golf/physics/CLAUDE.md` when working with that code). DO NOT RUN
  THE PHYSICS TESTS WHEN MAKING CHANGES ELSEWHERE IN THE CODEBASE.

## Key Concepts

**ROM memory model**: NES ROMs use bank switching. The fixed bank ($C000-$FFFF, bank 15)
holds pointer tables and lookup data; switchable banks ($8000-$BFFF) hold compressed
course data. `RomReader` translates CPU addresses to PRG ROM offsets.

**Bank layout constraints**: the switchable banks hold tables and code as well as course data:

| Bank | Contents | Course Data Region | Available Space |
|------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 0 | Japan terrain + tables | $8000-$A23D | 8,766 bytes |
| 1 | US terrain + tables | $8000-$A1E5 | 8,678 bytes |
| 2 | UK terrain + tables | $837F-$A553 | 8,661 bytes |
| 3 | All greens + code | $81C0-$A773 | 9,652 bytes |

Bank 2 has scene object data *before* terrain at $8000-$837E. Bank 3 has decompression
tables at $8000-$81BF, and code and data at $A774-$BFFF (the replay code and the CPU
opponents' recorded shots). `CoursePatch` (`golf/core/patches/course.py`) enforces these
boundaries, and uses only banks 0 and 1 for terrain. Full details: the `nes-open-golf-rom-layout` skill.

**One course per ROM**: `golf-write` writes a single 18-hole course with `CoursePatch`,
packing terrain across banks 0 and 1 with a per-hole bank table at $A700 in bank 3. The
patch requires `multi_bank_lookup`, `course_mirrors` (every course slot plays course 1)
and `wram_expansion` (terrain and attribute buffers sized for 60-row holes), which
`golf-write` applies first. See `docs/multi_bank_terrain.md`.

**Building ROMs**: `golf-patch` builds a ROM or IPS patch from a JSON recipe and/or inline
`-p` steps through `PatchStack`, which checks the base ROM hash, each patch's `requires`,
and that no two steps write the same byte. Patch types are registered in
`golf/core/patches/registry.py`; a new patch needs an entry there to be reachable from
recipes and the CLI. See `docs/patch_stack.md`.

**Two compression schemes**, easily confused:
- Course terrain/greens: RLE + dictionary, horizontal transitions, vertical fill
  (`golf/core/decompressor.py`, `compressor.py`; `golf/core/compression.md`). Terrain
  tables live in the fixed bank, greens tables in bank 3.
- *Everything the PPU displays* - pattern data, nametables, attribute tables - uses a
  separate stream codec (`$D4C3`, `golf/core/graphics_codec.py`). The cartridge has no CHR
  ROM, so about a third of the PRG is data in this format. See `docs/course_intro_scene.md`.

**Inspecting the ROM**: use `golf-rom-peek` (logic in `golf/core/rom_analysis.py`) and its
skill rather than one-off Python. The skill documents four ways a naive byte search or
linear disassembly silently lies about this ROM; a "no references found" is never proof
an address is dead.

**Writing new 6502 code**: use `golf/core/asm6502.py` (two-pass, labels, local labels,
`.org/.byte/.word/.res/.align`, branch-range checks) rather than hand-assembling byte
arrays. Existing small patches in `golf/core/patches/` predate it and stay as they are.

**Vanilla data**: course data dumped from a ROM is not committed: no course JSON, and none of the
rangefinder's rendered images or metadata. `golf-rehydrate` (logic in
`golf/randomizer/rehydrate.py`) dumps the US ROM and, if present, the JP ROM into
`courses/`, checks every hole against the content hashes in `data/catalog/holes.json`
before installing any, and renders the rangefinder. Run it once after cloning, and again
whenever the dumpers or renderer change. `golf-site` refuses to start until the data
matches. The checked-in `data/` tables, `renders/` images and the catalog's hashes stay,
and so does Mario Open's course intro sky
(`golf/core/patches/data/course_intro_sky.png`), which the `course_intro_sky` patch draws (ADR 0019).

## Development Notes

### Adding CLI tools

1. Put the tool in the matching `tools/` subpackage (or the top level if none fits) with a
   `main()` function. Keep it a thin CLI: logic that tests or other tools would import
   belongs in `golf/`.
2. Add an entry point under the matching comment group in `[project.scripts]` in
   `pyproject.toml`, then `uv sync`.
3. Add it to the command index in `README.md`.

### Keeping the repo navigable

The indexes and pointers above only stay useful if changes keep them current:

- **New or renamed doc**: add it to `docs/README.md`.
- **Moving or renaming a file**: grep for the old path across the CLAUDE.md files,
  `docs/` and `.claude/skills/`, and fix every reference - tests catch backticked paths in
  the agent-facing docs, but not prose or the individual docs under `docs/`.
- **Rules that only apply to one area** go in that area's nested CLAUDE.md (create one if
  needed), keeping this file about repo-wide concerns.
- **Skills are versioned in `.claude/skills/`**: when you learn something a skill should
  say, or find a statement in one that is no longer true, edit the skill.

`tests/meta/` holds tests of the repository itself, which enforce the mechanical parts:

- `test_cli_index.py` - every entry point is in the `README.md` command index
- `test_entry_points.py` - every entry point's module and function resolve
- `test_docs_index.py` - every doc is in `docs/README.md`, and its links resolve
- `test_referenced_paths.py` - backticked paths in the CLAUDE.md files, `README.md`,
  `docs/README.md` and the skills exist
- `test_tools_layering.py` - nothing imports from `tools/`, and `tools/archive/` has no entry points
- `test_import_order.py` - every module in `golf/`, `server/`, `editor/` and `tools/`
  imports cleanly in a fresh interpreter
- `test_pypy_ready.py` - the difficulty solver's imports use no 3.12-only syntax and
  nothing from `golf/core/patches/`, so it runs under PyPy 3.11
- `test_adrs.py` - every record in `docs/adr/` is well formed, supersession links agree,
  the index is current, and every ADR citation names a record that exists

### Linting, formatting and type checking

`uv run golf-check` runs ruff (lint and format) and pyright over the Python, djLint over
the Jinja templates, Biome over the site's JS and CSS, and codespell over every tracked
file; `--fix` formats and applies safe fixes. Configuration is in `pyproject.toml` and `biome.jsonc`. The tools' output is the
house style: Python is formatted by `ruff format` at 88 columns, and code that disagrees
with a tool is not precedent. Biome is not a Python package; `golf-biome`
(`tools/dev/biome.py`) downloads a pinned, hash-checked binary, so no Node tooling is involved.

### Spelling

The repo uses American spelling - color, center, behavior, labeled, initialize - in code,
identifiers, docs and label names alike. Don't match a British spelling in surrounding
code; fix it. codespell (configured in `pyproject.toml`) catches the common ones in
`golf-check`, and reports rather than rewrites them.

### JSON inspection

When inspecting JSON files in `courses/` and `data/`, prefer `jq` over `python -c` one-liners.

## Testing

Tests must be executed and must pass after all changes. There are no "ok failures". Ever.

```bash
uv run pytest                                   # everything, with coverage, across all cores
uv run pytest tests/unit/                       # unit tests only
uv run pytest tests/integration/                # integration tests only
uv run pytest tests/meta/                       # tests of the repo's docs, indexes and layering
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_vertical_fill.py  # one file
uv run pytest -n 0                              # serially, when a worker's output is in the way
uv run pytest --physics tests/physics           # the physics checks; only after editing golf/physics/
```

Fixtures live in `tests/fixtures/` and `tests/conftest.py`: real compression tables from
`data/tables/compression_tables.json`, minimal mock tables, and hand-crafted terrain/greens.

A test that needs real holes asks for the `vanilla_courses` fixture (NES Open) or
`vanilla_jp_courses` (Mario Open), and one that needs the rangefinder's renders for
`rangefinder_assets`. They skip when the matching ROM is absent and fail when it is present
but `golf-rehydrate` has not been run, so tests never read vanilla data from the repository
and never pass silently on a machine that could run them. They also mark the test
`vanilla_data`. A test that only needs *a* hole should use `tests/synthetic_holes.py` so it runs on a fresh
clone.

## Claude Code Preferences

- **Commit messages**: Please do not author commit messages. I prefer to write them myself to capture the specific context and rationale.  Claude does not need to happily announce the fact that no commit has been made, it is assumed.
- **Updating documentation**: When planning changes that would contradict or obsolete information in this CLAUDE.md file, a nested one, a doc under `docs/`, or a skill, include a step in your plan to update it accordingly. This ensures documentation stays current with the codebase; the tests in `tests/meta/` can only check that references exist, not that what they say is still true.
